    <h1>About</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Hi, I’m Rian Coetzee. I'm an aspiring and motivated web developer. I'm hard working, creative, aesthetically minded 
and passionate about web development. I enjoy learning new skills and are a problem solver.
My main concentration is in Javascript, node.js, react, express, next and jsx. I also have a great interest in swift(Xcode). 
I started my career in Media as a Video Editor. Doing Video production, music and sound engineering brought me much self discipline.
 Coding is the way forward though.

name was Legal TV. I worked there as a Camera Operator sometimes and also in the Sound Room as Sound Engineer.
